## 📌 Project Overview

This final project was developed as part of **Sprint 9** of the **QA course at TripleTen**.  
It demonstrates the full cycle of **planning**, **executing**, and **documenting** manual functional tests for a **Web application** and **API endpoints** within the **Urban Routes** ecosystem.

The project simulates a real-world QA scenario involving writing detailed test cases, running tests under time constraints, logging and tracking bugs in **JIRA**, and consolidating all results and evidence in **Google Sheets**.

Initially, the scope included **mobile app testing**, but due to technical issues with the app build, the mobile tests could not be executed and were postponed for future improvement.

## 🎯 Project Goal

- Plan, write, and execute functional test cases for the Web application and its API.
- Log and track bugs effectively in **JIRA**.
- Consolidate results, test cases, and bug reports in **Google Sheets**.
- Deliver clear evidence for identified issues.

> **Note:** Mobile app testing was planned but could not be executed due to a technical issue with the app build. This remains an opportunity for future execution.

## 🔧 Technologies and Tools

- **Manual Testing**
- **Postman** — API Testing
- **JIRA** — Bug Tracking and Reporting
- **Google Sheets** — Test Case Management and Execution Results

## ▶️ How to Execute

### 🖥️ **Web Application**
1. Launch the web application server.
2. Validate the prioritized functional requirements.
3. Capture evidence and log any defects in JIRA.

### 🔗 **API**
1. Run the backend server.
2. Review the API documentation (apiDoc).
3. Use **Postman** to send POST and DELETE requests.
4. Validate API responses and database updates.
5. Report any issues found in JIRA.

> **Note:** The **Urban Routes** server must be running for the tests to run properly.

---

## 🧾 Results

- **96** Web test cases were created and executed.
- **43** API test cases were created and executed.
- A total of **35 bugs** were identified and tracked in **JIRA**.

---

## 📚 What I Learned

- Planning and prioritizing tests effectively under tight deadlines.
- Hands-on experience with multi-platform testing (Web, Mobile, API).
- Clear and traceable bug reporting using JIRA.
- Organizing execution evidence in collaborative tools like Google Sheets.

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Extend tests to cover the **Mobile app** version.
- Automate critical Web and API scenarios using **Python + Selenium**.
- Integrate automated tests into a **CI/CD pipeline**.
- Expand exploratory test coverage for edge cases.
